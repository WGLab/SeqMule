# SeqMule: Automated human exome/genome variants detection

SeqMule takes single-end or paird-end FASTQ or BAM files, generates a script consisting of more than 10 popular alignment, analysis tools and runs the script line by line. Users can change the pipeline or fine-tune the parameters by modifying its configuration file. SeqMule also has some built-in functions, such as pooling consensus calls from various callers, plotting a Venn diagram showing intersection among different callers, and downloading databases. SeqMule can be used for both Mendelian disease study and cancer genome study.

## Features

* Mendelian disease and cancer genome analysis
  
   Suitable for both Mendelian disease study and tumor-normal paired somatic mutation analysis

* Multiple aligners

   BWA-MEM, BWA-BACKTRACK, Bowtie, Bowtie2, SOAP2, SNAP

* Multiple variant callers

   GATK, SAMtools, VarScan, SOAPsnp, Freebayes are available.

   As stated on 1000 Genomes Project website, genotypes obtained through a consensus procedure are estimated to have 30% fewer errors than those generated by any single caller. 

   As we have demonstrated in a previous study (O'Rawe et al. *Genome Med* 2013, **5**:28), consensus calls from multiple calling algorithms may increase calling accuracy and reduce Mendelian error rates.

* Easy downloading and installation.

   Most jobs can be done with one-line command.

* Fast and easy customization

   Just use predefined `advanced_config` or change it yourself!

* Sun Grid Engine (SGE) integration

   SeqMule is scalable and can utilize cluster computation resources managed by SGE.


## Synopsis

* **seqmule download**: download databases/BEDs that are required by sequence alignment or variant calling software tools

* **seqmule pipeline**: perform the automated pipeline for detection of variants from whole-exome/genome data

* **seqmule stats**: perform statistical analysis of variants data, such as drawing Venn diagram to examine overlap between VCF files, generating union/consensus ca
lls, generating coverage/alignment statistics in specific genomic regions, calculating Mendelian error rates

* **seqmule run**: continue run from last executed step after interruption or run from a specific step

* **seqmule update**: perform automated update of the SeqMule software tools
**See `doc/User Manual/Manuals` for details**
